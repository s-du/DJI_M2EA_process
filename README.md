# DJI_M2EA_process
This simple code allows to run a GUI for DJI Mavic 2 Entreprise Advanced (DJI M2EA) image processing.

## DJI M2EA limitations
As many DJI M2EA users now, the image options available on the controller are limited. In particular, there is no option to change the temperature range. The drone auto-adapts the temperature measurement range, which is quite annoying for photogrammetry applications.
Luckily, DJI provides a Thermal SDK, which is used here.
